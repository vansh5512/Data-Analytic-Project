# Data-Analytic-Project
📊 Multiple Feature Dataset Analysis
This project focuses on exploring and analyzing a multi-feature dataset using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The dataset contains various numerical and/or categorical features suitable for exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical summaries, and visualization.

📁 Dataset
The file MultipleFeatureDataset.csv includes multiple columns representing features such as:

Continuous or categorical variables

Possibly labeled data (for supervised learning)

Ideal for regression, classification, or general analysis tasks

You can preview the dataset using:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("MultipleFeatureDataset.csv")
df.head()
